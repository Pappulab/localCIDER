## Das sequences
I've included a comparison of the famous Das & Pappu [1] sequences with the actual sequences and kappa [1] and SCD [2] calculated as a `.csv`.

[1] Das RK, Pappu RV. Conformations of intrinsically disordered proteins are influenced by linear sequence distributions of oppositely charged residues. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2013;110: 13392â€“13397.
