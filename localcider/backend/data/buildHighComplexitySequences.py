   Stand alone program to compute the maximally complex sequences associated with
   a string of length *n* made of a 20 letter alphabet. Note that while proteins
   have some bias towards particular amino acids (i.e. few Trp, lots of Leu) the
   maximally complexity sequence is a theoretical max which selects uniformly from
   the 20 amino acids. This is a distinction related to how we define complexity -
   i.e. here complexity is defined in an absolute entropic sense and not in a
   way biased towards the maximally complex sequence seen in nature. In practice
   this probably means that you will never see a natural sequence with a complexity  
   of 1, so one pratical post-processing approach might be to normalize sequences
   by the most complex natural sequence you observe to get a sense of relative 
   complexity.

   We felt that by providing a raw, entropic/information theoretic measure of 
   complexity and then suggesting that users use that in whatever means they 
   want is a much safer way, rather than assuming some biasing will apply to
   all users' needs.

   This isn't really part of localCIDER, but may be useful for theoretical calculatoins
   associated with complexity. Be wary of depleting the entropy pool, though!
